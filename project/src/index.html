              If you aren’t bound for Seychelles’ outer coral reefs, there are
              endless pristine places to swim around its central islands. Here,
              a snorkeler explores the aquarium-clear waters off tiny Île Cocos,
              a picture-book island in miniature. A protected nature reserve
              with a palm grove at its heart, the island itself is out of
              bounds, but the ocean around its white-sand shores is a popular
              spot for snorkellers and divers. An easy excursion from La Digue
              or Praslin, here you might swim with eels, sea turtles or even
              whale sharks.

              There is a crystal-clear reason why the Seychelles regularly tops
              beach polls – but while the white-silica celebrity of such bays as
              La Digue’s Anse Source d'Argent, Praslin’s Anse Lazio, or Mahé’s
              Anse Intendance will always grab the headlines, it’s the unnamed,
              untamed beaches that make Seychelles such a stellar spot for
              nature lovers. This is terrain to claim as your own, at least for
              a few hours, where sparkling shoals of fish dart through turquoise
              waters, and only fragrant mangrove flowers litter powder-soft
              sands.

              This little uninhabited islet near Île Cocos is how the Seychelles
              would have looked to Portuguese sailors when they became the first
              Europeans to spot the archipelago, upon which no landing was
              recorded until a British East India Company ship arrived there in
              1609. Largely unsettled until the 1800s, these remote tropical
              islands were a staging post for pirates, buccaneers and privateers
              – but now offer pioneering terrain for those keen to make
              adventurous exploration by kayak, canoe, or paddleboard.

              Beautiful teardrop-shaped La Digue, with its fringe of pink
              granite boulders and string of pristine, untouched white-sand
              beaches, is the quintessential Seychelles hideaway for those who
              want to go off-grid and back to nature. Within easy ferry-hopping
              distance of the hub islands of Mahé and Praslin, cars are strictly
              limited on this tiny island that measures around five kilometres
              long and three kilometres wide. The best way to navigate La
              Digue’s main coastal road is by bike; pack a picnic, as once you
              leave the port there’s little by way of restaurants beyond the
              occasional shack selling sweetly spiced fish curries.

              Though best known for its marine life, Seychelles is equally
              humming with birdlife. The archipelago’s avian biodiversity
              attracts nature lovers from far and wide, keen to record both
              endemic and rare species, from the Seychelles paradise-flycatcher
              to the Seychelles scops-owl, the pure-white fairy tern to the
              black parrot, the country’s national bird. Huge colonies of
              seabirds roost and breed here between globe-spanning migratory
              journeys: some 1.5 million sooty terns amass on Bird Island each
              spring, while the jungle-fringed summits of Aride are home to 10
              breeding species of seabirds in some of the world’s highest
              concentrations.

              Set just four degrees south of the equator, some 1,600 kilometres
              off the shores of East Africa, the Seychelles offers up exotic,
              diverse, and wildly contrasting landscapes – from coral island
              idylls to the forested peaks of its inner granite islands. Here,
              on the main island of Mahé, this endemic Seychelles species of
              carnivorous pitcher plant, which feeds on insects trapped in its
              liquid-filled cups, is among numerous weird and wonderful flora
              flanking the national park trails that wind through the island’s
              verdant, mountainous hinterland. Walkers may also hear the tiny
              Seychelles frog and spot several species of orchid.

              Silhouette, a magnificent granite island, is the third-largest in
              the archipelago. This green and serene hideaway juts dramatically
              out of the Indian Ocean blue – a nature reserve where the
              surrounding waters are also protected as a marine conservation
              area. The island’s highest point, Mount Dauban, is a steeply
              forested 780-meter mountain peak and a natural nursery for endemic
              flowering plants as well as the vulnerable Seychelles kestrel.
              Trails here offer views of pristine bays and palm-shaded coves.
              The island is also home to one of the last significant roosts of
              the critically endangered Seychelles sheath-tailed bat.

              Scissor-tail sergeants, two-spot red snappers, and a blacktip reef
              shark swim in the shallow lagoon of Saint Joseph Atoll. Famed for
              its rainbow array of reef species, Seychelles is a hotspot for
              divers and snorkelers, many of whom choose to navigate the
              pristine waters around such distant atolls on liveaboard cruises
              that can access the archipelago’s many dive sites and impressively
              barnacled wrecks. Dive into a sub-aqua world and you can expect to
              encounter Technicolor reefs, vast schools of pelagic fish,
              dolphins, whale sharks, and rays.
