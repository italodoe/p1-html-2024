      <h1>Ezekiel 25:17</h1>
      <img src="../public/img/samuelLJ.jpg" />
      <p>
        The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of
        the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name
        of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the
        darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
        children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
        furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And
        you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.
