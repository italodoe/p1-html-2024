            The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
            inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he
            who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak
            through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's
            keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
            thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to
            poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when
            I lay my vengeance upon you.

              I been sayin' that sh*t for years. And if you ever heard it, it
              meant your *ss. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought
              it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherf*ck*r before
              you popped a cap in his *ss. But I saw some sh*t this mornin' made
              me think twice.
